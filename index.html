    <li>C – Parallelism → All verbs are in the same form.</li>
    <li>E – Misplaced Modifier → Describes hikers clearly.</li>
    <li>C – Subject-Verb Agreement → "Bouquet" is singular → "was given."</li>
    <li>D – Run-on Sentence → Correctly joined with "and."</li>
    <li>E – Comma Splice → Fixed using "so."</li>
    <li>E – Apostrophe Misuse → Correct = teacher’s lounge.</li>
    <li>B – Word Order → Natural subject–verb–object order.</li>
